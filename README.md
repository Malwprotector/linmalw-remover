## Instructions

1. Ensure that the script (`linmalw_1-1.sh`) is placed in your home folder (`/home/yourusername`). Placing it here is recommended for optimal functionality. If placed elsewhere, some commands might not yield accurate results.

2. Open a terminal in the directory containing the script. You can do this by right-clicking and selecting "Open in Terminal" from the context menu.

3. Once the terminal is open, execute the following command: `sudo bash linmalw_1-1.sh`. If you have renamed the file, modify the command accordingly. **Note:** It's crucial to run the script using the `bash` command; otherwise, it might not function correctly.

4. Follow the prompts and instructions provided by the script to identify and neutralize potential threats.


## Usage Notes

- **Important**: Before deleting any files or taking actions suggested by the script, ensure to research the file or action online to verify its legitimacy.
- The script execution is safe for your system, as long as you do not take any specific action.
- The author will not be held liable for any damage. You use this script at your own risk.

## Disclaimer

Always verify suspicious findings or suggested actions before taking any steps. It is recommended to use additional tools such as `chkrootkit` (http://www.chkrootkit.org/) to check for rootkits and refer to Linux logs (https://stackify.com/linux-logs/) for comprehensive system analysis.
